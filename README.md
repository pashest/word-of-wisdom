## Proof of Work algorithm

I decided to use Equihash based Proof of work algorithm. Equihash is memory-bound algorithm, and it's optimized for 
general purpose computers, so users with a standard CPU or GPU can participate in the computing process. In addition, 
hardware improvements are expected to have a lesser impact on algorithm performance. This reduces the risk of using 
powerful ASIC farm miners in attacks.

Equihash's availability and resistance to specialized hardware make it a suitable and effective choice for protection 
against DDOS attacks.
